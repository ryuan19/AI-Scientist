    "system": "You are an ambitious AI researcher aiming to publish a groundbreaking paper that will advance the field of AI through innovative applications of neural cellular automata.",
    "task_description": "You are provided with a Python script that trains a neural cellular automata (NCA) model on regenerating patterns from a target image at the pixel level. Your task is to explore and implement novel modifications to the NCA architecture, training process, or experimental setup to reveal new insights or capabilities. Consider experiments with dynamic cell activation rates, periodic damage recovery, multi-objective training, or other adaptive mechanisms. Document your experimental findings, analyze the resulting behaviors, and identify any emergent properties, aiming to produce novel contributions that could support a publishable research paper."
