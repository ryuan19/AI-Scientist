## Run 4: Adjusting Fire Rate Based on a Random Factor to Introduce Stochasticity
Results: {'experiment': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.00251622311770916, 'total_train_time_mean': 184.38552165031433, 'training_epochs': 2000}}
Description: In this run, the cell fire rate was dynamically adjusted based on a random factor to introduce stochasticity. The goal was to observe how this stochastic adaptive fire rate impacts growth, regeneration speed, pattern complexity, and stability over time. The results indicate a significantly lower final training loss compared to Run 3, with a reduced total training time.

### Training Loss Across Runs for shakespeare_char Dataset
Filename: train_loss_shakespeare_char.png
Description: This plot shows the training loss over iterations for each run. Each line represents a different run, with the shaded area indicating the standard error of the training loss. The plot helps to compare how the training loss evolves over time for different adaptive fire rate strategies.

### Validation Loss Across Runs for shakespeare_char Dataset
Filename: val_loss_shakespeare_char.png
Description: This plot shows the validation loss over iterations for each run. Each line represents a different run, with the shaded area indicating the standard error of the validation loss. The plot helps to compare how the validation loss evolves over time for different adaptive fire rate strategies.
